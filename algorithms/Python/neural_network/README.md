# A very very simple Neural Network

This is my own Neural Network implementation with a little use case. It works wery well.

This implementation aims be a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the main goal is improve it adding more features like loss 
functions, more activation functions, metrics, etc.

For run this codes you must install ```pandas``` and ```numpy```.
